# GridLAB-D Wrapper for UCEF

This repository integrates the power distribution system simulator GridLAB-D (http://www.gridlabd.org/) into the Universal Cyber-Physical Systems Environment for Federation (UCEF). It is meant to be used in conjunction with the UCEF virtual machine available at https://github.com/usnistgov/ucef and cannot be used on its own.
